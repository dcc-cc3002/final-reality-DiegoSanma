# Final Reality

Final Reality is a simplified clone of the renowned game, Final Fantasy. Its main purpose is to
serve as an educational tool, teaching foundational programming concepts.

This version of Final Reality, shall implement various aspects of Final Fantasy, but also add 
different ways and methods to implement actions and situations

## I. Playable Characters
A player will be allowed to choose from a variety of different classes, that can be separated into two 
categories, Mages and Characters. Each one of them will be restricted to maximum values to their stats,
different for each class, to ensure that different players with different classes specialize in different 
aspects during combat.
### I.I Characters
This category of player can be separated will be separated into three classes, paladins, guerreros(warriors)
and ninjas. In particular, guerreros will be heavy hitters with higher defense, at the cost of weighing more 
than the rest, while ninjas will be lighter, but with less attack and defense. Paladins will be considered an
option for an all round good character.
### I.II Mages
This category divides into two, white and black mages. What makes them different from other characters, is the
use of mana and magic/ an aspect of the game that will be implemented later on. 
For mages, the main difference between them is that white mages have a higher maximum mana, while black mages
have higher attack and defense.
